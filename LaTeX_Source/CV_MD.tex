& \hspace{10pt} “Teacher Job Satisfaction and Student Achievement in New York City” (MA Thesis) \\ & \\
%& \hspace{10pt} This paper seeks to investigate the relationship between teacher satisfaction and student achievement at primary and secondary school levels in the New York City school system. Using data from the NYC Department of Education, I estimate numerous models in an attempt to break any possible endogeneity bias and arrive at the most accurate estimates possible. I find that teacher satisfaction has a statistically significant and positive effect on student achievement. Despite a weak identifier in my instrumental variable models, which prevents any causal inference, I find an associative relationship between teacher satisfaction and student achievement that may be useful to policymakers in their efforts to improve student outcomes. \\ & \\
